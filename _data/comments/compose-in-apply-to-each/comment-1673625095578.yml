message: "Hi Ondrej,\r\n\r\nThank you for the article! Clever use of Compose to improve performance.\r\n\r\nCan you describe \" You just need to create a child flow\" in a little more detail when using compose inside a nested loop? Does this mean creating a second flow to return data for this flow? Would that have an affect on performance?"
