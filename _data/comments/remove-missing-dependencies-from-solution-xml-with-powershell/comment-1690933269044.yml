  Hello. I stumbled upon this article recently when trying to figure out why
  Missing Dependency lines were getting added to the Solution.xml file
  referencing components that were in the solution. As an example, there is an
  new entity that I added to the solution along with a relationship. Despite
  being in the solution, both components are getting listed as Missing
  Dependencies. I was able to unpack the solution and remove the lines from the
  solution.xml file, but I was wondering if you had any insight into why they
  were getting added in the first place. Thank you.
